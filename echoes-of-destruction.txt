<h2>Detailed Synopsis</h2>

<p>IKARI, first a slave, then a thief, finally accepts that he is alone in the world. But when he sustains a life-threatening injury, he is saved by a kind old man. In return, Ikari sets off on a journey to find the power of the Phoenix in order to pay back the debt. Begrudgingly, he allows a determined pacifist to accompany him, representing everything he is not.


<br><br>Back in Faydria, HIKOSHI, Ikariâ€™s old mentor, is firmly under the thumb of ALPHA, an occult leader of a fractured nation. Dangling the bait of vengeance and the safety of his remaining friends, Alpha sends Hikoshi across the world to find ancient relics of the past, but his plans are revealed to be much more sinister than Hikoshi imagined.</p>
